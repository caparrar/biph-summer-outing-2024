                <p>Dear Bi,</p>
                <br>

                <p>As our paths diverge, I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the time we've shared together. Your presence has brought immense joy, laughter, and warmth into my life, and for that, I am truly thankful.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Though it's difficult to bid farewell, I am filled with gratitude for the memories we've created and the experiences we've shared. Each moment spent with you has been a gift, and I will carry them with me always.</p>

                <br>

                <p>As you embark on this new journey, may you find endless opportunities, boundless happiness, and the fulfillment of your dreams. Know that you will be dearly missed, but your spirit will forever remain a cherished part of my life.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Thank you, Donna, for everything you've been and everything you've brought into my life. Farewell, and may the future hold nothing but blessings and happiness for you.</p>

                <br>

                <p>With heartfelt appreciation,</p>
                <p>Arvs</p>
